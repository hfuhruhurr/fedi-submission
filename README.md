## Background
This repo exists to serve as the Proof of Work for my answers to the challenge questions posed to me by the Fedi Engineering team.

Note: The source database is not included in the repo since it's too big for github.

Note: The same goes for the parquet files made from the source database.

All the logic of how I derived the parquet files from the source database can be found in `setup.ipynb`.

## Quick answers to the Basic Challenge questions
1) 8.42375871 BTC
2) 7.81928988 BTC
3) 60,446,883,000 msats

The actual Proof of Work can be seen in `basic_challenge.ipynb`.

## Extra Challenges
See `extra_challenge_1.md` and `extra_challenge_2.md`.
